					<blockquote>“I was in the library of a home that felt centuries old. It was cozy and safe in the library but I knew that outside, a terrible plague was ravaging the world. It felt much more like Europe during the <span class="ev">Black Plague</span> than modern <span class="key" about="COVID-19">COVID-19</span> times,” said Barrett who used the image of a plague doctor wandering a landscape of <span class="key" about="COVID-19">COVID-19</span> particles to represent her <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>.</quote>

		</div>
		<p>Much of <span class="pers" about="Deirdre Barrett">Deirdre Barrett</span>’s work has involved the study of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, particularly the distressing <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> and <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span> of those affected by trauma, including combat veterans, former <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/10/dream-saga-of-wwii/">prisoners of war</a>, and <span class="ev">9/11</span> first responders. More recently, the assistant professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/"><span class="company" about="Harvard Medical School">Harvard Medical School</span></a>, whose books include “<span class="co" about="The Committee of Sleep">The Committee of Sleep</span>” and “<span class="co" about="Trauma and Dreams">Trauma and Dreams</span>,” has created an <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/B8S75CN">online survey</a> to collect the <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> of people living through the <span class="key" about="coronavirus">coronavirus</span> <span class="key" about="pandemic">pandemic</span>. To date she has more than 2,500 responses recounting more than 6,000 <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. <span class="pers" about="Deirdre Barrett">Barrett</span> spoke with the <span class="company" about="Gazette">Gazette</span> about how she sees the outbreak affecting the quality and content of people’s <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>.</p>
		<span class="app"><h3>Q&A</h3></span>
		<span class="app"><h6><span class="pers" about="Deirdre Barrett">Deirdre Barrett</span></h6></span>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: What exactly is happening in our subconscious during periods of extreme stress? How is that manifesting in our <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="pers" about="Deirdre Barrett">BARRETT</span>: When we <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>, our brain is in this state where visual areas are much more active than when we’re awake, and on average, emotional areas are a little more active. Our prefrontal cortex right behind our forehead, which controls the most precise linear logic and also censors inappropriate social things, as well as the right way to do things in our professional thinking, is very much damped down. Our verbal areas are somewhat less active. So, I think we’re thinking about the same things that we were most focused on by day, but in this other state of consciousness. We have more intuitive thinking and less linear thinking about things. Once in a while, we’ll see that our unconscious looks much more scared than we’re feeling by day or provides us with some optimistic perspective that we haven’t had by day. But I think in general, being anxious by day and having <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> correlate both as traits that a person carries over long periods of time, but also as a state for a short period of time when there’s a stressor.</p>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: Do you think extra <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, or lack of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, might contribute to vivid <span class="key" about="coronavirus">coronavirus</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>?</p>
		<p class="answer"><span class="pers" about="Deirdre Barrett">BARRETT</span>: More <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> than usual, such as many people are getting now, means more <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> time. And it’s not just proportional: Our last REM period of the night is the longest and more “dense” in REM, which correlates with long, vivid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, so an alarm clock chopping off a bit of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> chops off a lot of <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span>. The relationship to insomnia is more complicated. If one is simply sleeping a shorter time, then there’s less <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span>. However, if less <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> is because of frequent awakenings — whether due to noise, <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span>, etc. — one is likely to awaken out of more REM periods, which results in more <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> recall though not more actual <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span>.</p>

		<p>GAZETTE: Broadly, are you seeing patterns or themes in the <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> you’ve been collecting through your survey?</p>
		<p>BARRETT: I’m noticing big clusters of <span class="key"about="dream">dream</span> content. One is very literally about getting the <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span> — that’s been a fairly common <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> where the person is short of breath or spiking a fever. Or sometimes it’s a little more fantastic. One woman looked down and saw blue stripes on her stomach and remembered in the <span class="key"about="dream">dream</span> that was supposed to be the first sign of a <span class="key" about="COVID-19">COVID-19</span> infection. Then there are metaphors for the <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span> — there’s a big sub-cluster of <span class="key" about="bug">bug</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. After<span class="ev" about="9/11">9/11</span>, I saw metaphors as well as literal <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> about those events. But I didn’t see bug <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> after <span class="ev" about="9/11">9/11</span>. And I’ve just seen dozens and dozens and dozens of every kind of <span class="key" about="bug">bug</span> imaginable attacking the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span>: There are swarms of every kind of flying insect you’ve ever heard of; there are armies of cockroaches racing at the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span>; there are masses of wriggling worms; there were some grasshoppers with vampire fangs; there are bed <span class="key" about="bug">bugs</span>, stink <span class="key" about="bug">bugs</span>.</p>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: What do you think that is about?</p>
		<p class="answer">BARRETT: When we say “I’ve got a <span class="key" about="bug">bug</span>,” that means “I’m sick” and often “I’ve got a <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span>.” So I think it’s partly just that association. But then a little bit deeper than just the word, I think, is the idea of lots of little things that cumulatively can hurt or kill you is really a very good metaphor for the <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span> particles.</p>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: Are you seeing other things that represent the <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span> in people’s <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>?</p>
		<p class="answer">BARRETT: I see every other bad event possible being plugged in as a metaphor for the <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span>. There are tsunamis and tornadoes and hurricanes and earthquakes and fires breaking out and mass shooters in the streets. And I did see all of those after <span class="ev" about="9/11">9/11</span>. But I think a somewhat higher proportion of these <span class="key" about="dream">>dreams</span> are metaphoric, because we don’t have one clear image that automatically goes with the <span class="key" about="COVID-19">COVID-19</span> <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span> or the <span class="key" about="pandemic">pandemic</span>. And yet the <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> mind is so visual that, when it’s feeling anxious and worried, it seeks to represent that with an appropriate visual image. For <span class="ev" about="9/11">9/11</span>, we saw plenty of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> about buildings falling down or planes crashing into things, and hijackers with knives. So today, there are a fair number of metaphoric ones and the metaphoric ones will often have a little bit of literal <span class="key" about="pandemic">pandemic</span> content. For instance, [New York Gov. Andrew] <span class="pers" about="Andrew Cuomo">Cuomo</span> will be telling people in their <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> that they have to shelter in their homes because of the shooters in the street or the swarms of <span class="key" about="bug">bugs</span>, or you need to put a mask on because of the swarms of <span class="key" about="bug">bugs</span>, or you’re sheltering at home because fires are breaking out, or [President] <span class="pers" about="Donald Trump">Trump</span> is telling you that the tsunami is fake news. So, they’ll have bits of sort of the real details included.</p>

		<p class="question">GAZETTE: Anything else that you’ve noticed specifically related to coronavirus?</p>
		<p class="answer">BARRETT: Early on, I saw an awful lot of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> that seemed to be sort of practicing mask wearing or social distancing. In about half of them, the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span> would be out in public and realize they didn’t have their mask and panic or realize they had gotten too close to someone. In the other half, they would be doing what they were supposed to, and other people would not have their masks on or be crowding in the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> or be coughing on the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span>. And they seemed like just these <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span> <span class="key"about="dream">dreams</span>. As you’re learning a new skill, you often kind of <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about what you’re trying to learn. There’s a little less emphasis on the, <q>I’m getting the <span class="key" about="virus">virus</span>,</q> either metaphorically or for real, in <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. What I’m beginning to see — these have been there from the start but they’re on the increase — are <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> about the aspects of the lockdown or other things that are an outgrowth of the <span class="key" about="pandemic">pandemic</span>. The most common is definitely the shelter-at-home stuff. People who are sheltering at home alone will <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> that they’ve been locked up in prison, or one woman was sent to <span class="pl" about="Mars">Mars</span> by herself to establish the first one-person <span class="pl" about="Mars">Mars</span> colony. There was a woman who in reality was homeschooling her child, but she dreamed that that someone had decided that her child’s entire class had to come and live with her. So you see <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> exaggerating isolation for some people or exaggerating crowding or a reduction in privacy rights for others. And those are on the increase, as are <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> about finding out all your money’s gone, or trying to get a job and not being able to.</p>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: Are you able to distinguish any differences in the <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> of those who are on the front lines? Or maybe even people who’ve had a diagnosis of <span class="key" about="COVID-19">COVID-19</span>?</p>
		<p class=answer>BARRETT: I have more than 600 health care workers now. It’s still a small part of the total sample, but I really see strong trends. Of the people who are working in the ICU or the emergency rooms or even just general medical units, in most cases they’re having full-on <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span>. And they look like trauma nightmares, meaning they’re not as dreamlike and bizarre and metaphorical as most of the other <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. They tend to involve taking care of someone who’s dying of <span class="key" about="COVID-19">COVID-19</span>, and they’re trying to do something like put a patient on a respirator, or get the tube reattached that’s come off a respirator, or the respirator machines are not working. So they feel like it’s their responsibility to save this person’s life, and yet they don’t actually have much control over it, and the person is dying anyway. That’s their <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmare</span>. It’s the worst moment from their daytime experiences.</p>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: Can you say more about the difference between <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span>, and trauma <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>?</p>
		<p class="answer">BARRETT: All <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> are not <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span>. We usually reserve the word <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmare</span> for <span class="key" about=dream>dreams</span> where somebody just feels overwhelmed with terror, as opposed to when <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span> dominates the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. But traumatic <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span> are really a thing unto themselves. They don’t look as dreamlike as <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. The vast majority of ordinary <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> and garden-variety <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span> are happening during rapid-eye-movement, or REM, <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>. That’s not true of traumatic <span class="key" about="nightmare">nightmares</span> when they’ve been studied in the <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> lab. They’re happening across all stages of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, which is really unusual. We think that they may actually be similar to what is happening with daytime flashbacks, that there are just these intrusive trauma memories that are intruding on your consciousness during any state of consciousness, from waking to <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> to what is usually nondreaming <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>.</p>
		<p class="question">GAZETTE: Is there anything we can do to try to control what we <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about?</p>
		<p class="answer">BARRETT: The best way to do that is to think of what you would like to <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about. You could pick out a person you’d like to see in your <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> tonight, or a favorite place. Some people enjoy flying <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, or some people have just had an all-time lifetime favorite <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. So pick what you’d like to <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about. And if it’s a general one, like a person or place, just visualize that person or place. Or you can put some photograph of what you’re trying to <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about on your nightstand so you look at it as the last thing before you go to <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>. If you have a particular favorite <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> you’re focusing on, you might try to replay that in detail before falling asleep. And that would make you likelier to have a similar <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. And that both makes it likelier that you’ll <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about that content, and it also makes it less likely you’ll have <span class="key" about="anxiety">anxiety</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>.</p>

			<p><span class="key" about="dream"><span class="special">D</span>reams</span> have fascinated philosophers and <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> for centuries. They have been seen as divine messages, a way of unleashing creativity and, since the advent of psychoanalysis in the 19th Century, the key to understanding our unconscious. As so many of us have been experiencing unusually vivid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> in recent weeks, it seems an opportune moment to explore the way in which they have been understood and depicted throughout the centuries. In doing so we may even find some intriguing parallels with our own experiences.</p>

		<p>But why are we <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> so vividly now? <q>We’re in a new situation so there’s new emotions to process,</q> says psychotherapist <span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Philippa Perry</span>, who was inundated with replies when she recently asked her followers to send her their <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> on <span class="company" about="Twitter">Twitter</span>. We make up narratives to make sense of those feelings that in <span class="key" about=dream>dream</span> manifest themselves <q>not straightforwardly but in metaphors</q>, she explains.</p>

		<p><span class="pers" about="Albrecht Dürer">Albrecht Dürer</span>’s <span class="co" about="Dream Vision">Dream Vision</span> (<span class="date" about="1525">1525</span>) is the first known depiction in Western <span class="key" about="art">art</span> of an <span class="key" about="art">artist</span>’s personal <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. The watercolour, seemingly hastily produced on waking, shows a deluge of water descending from the sky to engulf him. <q>I awoke trembling in every limb and it took a long time for me to recover,</q> he noted.</p>
		<p><span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Perry</span> says that although her training taught her there was no such thing as a <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> dictionary, decades of practice have shown her that <q>certain objects usually stand for a certain thing</q>, and <q>if somebody <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> about water that is usually about feelings</q>.  To her, it sounds as if <span class="pers" about="Albrecht Dürer">Dürer</span> was <q>drowning in feelings</q>, and although of course she cannot be sure what those feelings were, <q>most of us, whether we admit it or not, or are ignorant of it when awake, fear annihilation and oblivion</q>, she says.</p>
		<p>Perhaps it is unsurprising that many of the <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> <span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Perry</span> was sent on Twitter also involved people being engulfed with water, although the woman who <span class="key" about="dream">dreamt</span> she was surfing on a tsunami was clearly dealing with her emotions better than <span class="pers" about="Albrecht Dürer">Dürer</span>.</p>

		</figure>
		<p><span class="pers" about="Albrecht Dürer">Dürer</span>’s personal portrayal was, however, very much the exception. Although the Renaissance had stimulated interest in ancient philosophy’s study of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, this had to be reconciled with prevailing Christian ideology, which frowned upon pagan interpretations. Most <span class="key" about="painting">paintings</span> of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> were biblical in nature.</p>
		<p>The <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> of Jacob – as well as those Joseph interpreted for the Pharaoh – were favourite subjects: <span class="pers" about="Raphael">Raphael</span> painted them on to a ceiling in the <span class="pl" about="Vatican’s Palazzo Apostolico">Vatican’s Palazzo Apostolico</span> in <span class="date" about="1518">1518</span>. The vivid metaphors of the <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> are shown in spheres floating in the sky as if to emphasise that their comprehension was beyond mortal man. Mythological themes, such as <span class="pers" about="Lorenzo Lotto">Lorenzo Lotto</span>’s <span class="co" about="Sleeping Apollo and the Muses with Fame">Sleeping Apollo and the Muses with Fame</span> (<span class="date" about="1549">1549</span>), could, however, give <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> licence to suggest the relationship between <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> and inspiration. Apollo’s slumber appears to have given the muses free rein to throw off their clothes and frolic naked in the neighbouring meadow, suggesting the uninhibited creativity that <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> can unleash.</p>
		<p>The nightmarish contents of <span class="key" about="painting">paintings</span> by <span class="pers" about="Hieronymus Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</span> resonated with a far greater number of people. Their imagery was almost certainly understood not simply as the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span>’s representations of paradise and hellfire, but as representations of admonitory nightmares that might be visited on sinners to warn them of what awaited them should they not repent. This is made explicit in <span class="co" about="The Vision of Tundale">The Vision of Tundale</span> (c <span class="date" about="1520-30">1520-30</span>) by a follower of <span class="pers" about="Hieronymus Bosch">Bosch</span>, in which the sinful knight is seen hovering above his own nightmare vision of hell.</p>

		<p><span class="key" about="dream">Dreams</span> as <span class="key" about="art">artistic</span> subject matter largely fell out of favour in the rational era of the Enlightenment but the late <span class="date" about="18th Century">18th Century</span> saw the creation of one of the most famous depictions – <span class="co" about="The Nightmare">The Nightmare</span> (<span class="date" about="1781">1781</span>) by <span class="pers" about="Henry Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</span>. Without literary, biblical or <span class="key" about="art">art</span>-historical precedent, it has continued to defy interpretation, although some see it as prefiguring <span class="pers" about="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</span>’s psychoanalytical theories.</p>
		<p><span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Perry</span> doesn’t view the <span class="key" about="painting">painting</span> as a straightforward portrayal of nocturnal horrors. Instead, she sees in the defenceless pose of the woman, the horse’s unhealthy interest in her crotch, and the pose of the gremlin – which might suggest he is about to defecate on her – a <q>degradation of woman wet <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> that many a man might have</q>. Or, she adds, <q>a woman… our <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> and our sex fantasies are rarely politically correct, whatever gender we are.</q></p>
		<p><b>‘Draw your <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>’</b></p>
		<p>It was the Symbolists who returned <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> to the forefront of <span class="key" about="art">artistic</span> expression. For <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> such as <span class="pers" about="Gustave Moreau">Gustave Moreau</span> and <span class="pers" about="Odilon Redon">Odilon Redon</span>, <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> were a method of deciphering reality and the mysteries of existence. <span class="pers" about="Odilon Redon">Redon</span>>’s <span class="co" about="The Eye Like A Strange Balloon Mounts Towards Infinity">The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Towards Infinity</span> (<span class="date" about="1882">1882</span>), in which a hot air balloon in the form of an eye appears to be lifting a man’s head into the clouds, suggests the often incongruous imagery of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. It comes as no surprise that the movement had an impact on the Surrealists.</p>
		<p>Surrealism’s primary inspiration came from <span class="pers" about="Sigmund Freud">Freud</span>’s <span class="co" about="The Interpretation of Dreams">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>. According to <span class="pers" about="Sigmund Freud">Freud</span>, <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> are an expression of wish fulfilment distorted by self-censorship into imagery that makes no sense to the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span> upon waking. By unlocking their hidden meaning, he believed that psychoanalysis could cure patients of whatever was afflicting them.</p>

		<p>However, where <span class="pers" about="Sigmund Freud">Freud</span> saw <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> as something to be deciphered in order to cure, the Surrealists saw them as a means of unleashing uninhibited creative expression; a reaction against the bourgeois culture of Europe they had come to loathe in the aftermath of <span class="ev" about="World War One">World War One</span>.</p>
		<p>In Surrealist <span class="key" about="art">art</span>, the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span> is not usually depicted. Instead the viewer is directly confronted with the inner workings of the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. In <span class="pers" about="Giorgio de Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</span>’s anxiety laden dreamscapes or Max Ernst’s curious <span class="key" about="painting">paintings</span>, collages and multimedia works <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> take the form of puzzles that challenge the viewer’s perceptions of reality.</p>

		<p><span class="pers" about="Sigmund Freud">Freud</span>, it has to be said, was bewildered by their ideas, although he did slightly change his tune when he met <span class="pers" about="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</span> in <span class="date" about="1938">1938</span>. <span class="pers" about="Salvador Dalí">Dalí</span> had brought with him his <span class="key" about="painting">painting</span> <span class="co" about="Metamorphosis of Narcissus">Metamorphosis of Narcissus</span> (<span class="date" about="1937">1937</span>), in which the form of Narcissus gazing into a pool is duplicated by a finger and thumb clutching a cracked egg from which a Narcissus flower appears. <a href="https://www.freud.org.uk/2019/02/04/when-dali-met-freud/">Previously</a> <span class="pers" about="Sigmund Freud">Freud</span> had seen the Surrealists as <q>absolute (let us say 95%, like alcohol), cranks</q> – but <span class="pers" about="Salvador Dalí">Dalí</span>, with his <q>undeniable technical mastery</q>, made him reconsider his opinion.</p>
		<p><span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Perry</span> herself explored the Surrealist approach to <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> when she made the BBC Four documentary <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04ylxj9">How to be a Surrealist with <span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Philippa Perry</span></a> in 2017. Like them, she set up a Bureau of Surrealist Research and asked the public to tell her their <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> before asking them to draw them. <q>What is so moving is what they got from it when they relived their <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>,</q> she says.</p>

		<p>With patients, <span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Perry</span> generally uses Gestalt therapy, pioneered by the German psychiatrist <span class="pers" about="Fritz Perls">Fritz Perls</span>, which involves retelling your <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> to yourself from the point of view of all the objects in the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. The idea is that everything in your <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> is a part of you, so you’ll know what they’re going to say and will thus gain a better understanding of yourself.</p>
		<p>In our current situation <span class="pers" about="Philippa Perry">Perry</span> thinks multiple approaches will have benefit. <q>Draw your <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>; write the <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> down. All these things help you process the emotion and the feeling in the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>. You take ownership and therefore you take control,</q> she says.</p>
		<p>And, who knows, in the process we might unleash our own, hitherto unknown, creativity.</p>

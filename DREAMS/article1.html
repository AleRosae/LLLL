			<p><span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz"><span class="special">A</span>dam Haar Horowitz</span> is the first to admit that whispering to strangers as they fall <span class="key" about="sleep">asleep</span> <q>seems a little creepy.</q> He’d been mulling over the idea with fellow MIT master’s student <span class="pers" about="Ishaan Grover">Ishaan Grover</span> a few years ago while thinking about ways to influence the dreamlike visions people see at <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> onset, a state known as hypnagogia. The pair wondered if quietly saying words or phrases to people in hypnagogia might influence the content of their thoughts and visions, thereby serving both as a tool to investigate human cognition and, ultimately, as a means to help people wield control over their <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> brains.</p>
			<p><span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span> didn’t end up whispering into strangers’ ears, but he, Grover, and other <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/sleep-creativity/people/">collaborators</a> did find a way to execute the basic concept, using a more practical solution: a device that fits into a person’s hand to monitor changes in heart rate, muscle tone, and skin conductance—all of which help <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> determine the moment at which someone dozes off—paired with a computer or smartphone app that automatically plays audio prompts and records people’s spoken responses. The app <q>would speak to people when it guessed that they were at the end of hypnagogia before they go into something deeper,</q> <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span> says. After reporting what they were thinking about right at that moment, people would be allowed to nod off again, and the whole process could be repeated.</p>
			<p>In experiments detailed in <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span>’s <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/578c0c92b3db2b24714cd02d/t/5d4881e66315ae00011e0f55/1565032952853/Incubating+Dreams+Awakening+Creativity+Adam+Haar+Thesis+8.5.19-compressed.pdf">master’s thesis</a> and a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020300416">scientific paper</a> published earlier this year, people interacted easily with the setup, known as Dormio. They chatted with it, albeit somewhat nonsensically, about what they could see and feel as they slipped in and out of wakefulness. One volunteer, prompted by Dormio to think about a fork, described <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> about a family that was “happy to see the fork. And they’re putting it in a pumpkin,” according to <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span>’s thesis. Another participant, told to think about a tree, described <q>a tree from my childhood, from my backyard. It never asked for anything.</q></p>
			<p><span class="key" about="dream research">Dream researchers</span> who spoke with <i>The Scientist</i> say Dormio marks an exciting step for a field traditionally limited by scientists’ inability to interact with their study participants. Many experts define <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> broadly as any subjective experiences people have while <span class="key" about="sleep">asleep</span>, although most projects rely on <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports collected specifically from people woken up from rapid-eye movement (<span class="key" about="REM">REM</span>) <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, the stage of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> at which people are most likely to experience emotional, narrative <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> (though not the only <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> stage in which <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> can occur; see “The Stages of <span class="key" about="dream">Dreaming</span>” below). This time-consuming approach has been something of an obstacle to <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> interested in manipulating <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>—an important aspect of <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> <span class="key" about="research">research</span>, says <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span>, now a <span class="key" about="research">research</span> assistant in the Fluid Interfaces <span class="key" about="research">research</span> group at <span class="company" about="MIT">MIT</span>’s Media Lab. After all, he says, <q>you can’t do controlled experimentation on <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> without an ability to control <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>.”</q>

			<p><span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span> is one of a small but growing group of <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> who call themselves <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> engineers and are exploring various methods to influence people’s thoughts at <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> onset and during <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> itself. Some tools, like Dormio, use aural stimuli, while others harness sights or smells, or employ more-complex technologies such as noninvasive brain stimulation. With a recent wave of studies demonstrating the promise of such approaches, neuroscientists and psychologists may be able to learn more not only about how and why <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> are generated, but about possible health and cognitive applications of <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> control.</p>
			<p>Such techniques could help give <span class="key" about="dream research">dream researchers</span> the control they’re after, says <span class="company" about="Harward Medical School">Harvard Medical School</span> <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> <span class="key" about="research">researcher</span> <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Robert Stickgold</span>, <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span>’s mentor and collaborator. With these approaches, <q>we can use the scientific method.</q></p>
			<span class="app"><h3 id="Lucidity">Lucidity and other <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> experiences</h3></span>
			<p><span class="special">A</span>ttempts to influence <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> are by no means new. People dating as far back as the ancient Egyptians have been known to fast to induce vivid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, while scientists, philosophers, and artists have been experimenting for centuries with hashish, opium, and other drugs to conjure <span class="key" about="dream">dreamy</span> visions in and out of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>. Many cultures continue to hold beliefs about the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>-altering effects of certain foods—folklore in many Western societies holds that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00047/full">cheese</a> can induce vivid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, although there’s little scientific <span class="key" about="research">research</span> on the topic. And demand for <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/controlling-self-awareness-during-sleep-37510">lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span></a> classes designed to help people take control of their in-<span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> environments has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lucid-dreaming-alice-robb-why-we-dream/">taken off</a> in the last few years, helped along by <span class="pers" about="Christopher Nolan">Christopher Nolan</span>’s <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>-twisting <span class="date" about="2010">2010</span> blockbuster, <i><span class="co" about="Inception">Inception</span></i>.</p>
			<p><span class="key" about="dream">Dream</span> engineers are interested in finding reliable, <span class="key" about="research">researcher</span>-controlled ways to induce lucidity—where a <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span> becomes aware of being in a <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> and may be able to exert control over their actions and their environment, as well as other sensations such as flying, to investigate how those sensations are generated and whether they’re associated with any benefits for the person experiencing them. One method that’s received significant interest as a way to manipulate <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> sensations is noninvasive brain stimulation, which uses a magnetic coil or scalp electrodes to influence electrical activity in the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span>’s brain.</p>
			<p>In <span class="date" about="2013">2013</span>, a small study applied 10 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to people in <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span>, and concluded, based on reports people made after being woken up from <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span>, that the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24021850/">procedure increased lucidity</a> in <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> when compared to a sham procedure. A similar study the following year that applied either a sham procedure or bursts of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)—which is thought to be better than tDCS at influencing brain oscillations—concluded that 40 Hz currents during <span class="key" about="REM">REM</span> could also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3719">promote <span class="key" about="dream">dreamers</span> to become more self-aware</a>. However, in both studies, the effect was weak, and in the <span class="date" about="2013">2013</span> study it was only observed among people who said they already frequently experienced lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. That group is unlikely to be representative of the general population, for which <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> estimate that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810016301283">up to 50 percent</a> may never have experienced <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> lucidity.</p>
			<p><span class="company" about="The University of Montreal">The University of Montreal</span>’s <span class="pers" about="Tore Nielsen">Tore Nielsen</span>, who directs the Dream and Nightmare Laboratory at the <span class="company" about="Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine">Center for Advanced <span class="key" about="research">Research</span> in <span class="key" about="sleep">Sleep</span> Medicine</span>, is unconvinced that noninvasive brain stimulation works as a lucidity inducer. Like many <span class="key" about="dream research">dream researchers</span>, <span class="pers" about="Tore Nielsen">Nielsen</span> says he has experienced his fair share of lucid and otherwise extraordinary <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. He and his colleagues recently carried out their own study of tACS using stringent study conditions: for <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> to confirm a participant’s report of lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span>, that person had to give a signal on becoming lucid—flicking their eyes from left to right under their closed eyelids three times—and that had to happen during <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span>, as determined by <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/scientists-identify-more-precise-neural-correlates-of-dreaming-31675">electroencephalography</a> (EEG) analyses of their brain activity. <q>Much to our chagrin, we failed to replicate</q> the earlier findings, <span class="pers" about="Tore Nielsen">Nielsen</span> says. Although some participants did the eye-flick signal during <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span> and subsequently described vivid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, people were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810019305070">no more likely</a> to have lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> after receiving tACS than they were if they’d had the sham procedure.</p>
			<h3 id="StagesOfDreaming">THE STAGES OF <span class="key" about="dream">DREAMING</span></h3>
			<p><span class="special">N</span>euroscientists used to think that <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> took place almost exclusively during rapid-eye movement (<span class="key" about="REM">REM</span>) <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, a stage of slumber that is often accompanied by complex emotional, narrative-heavy <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> that can involve sensations such as flying or other movements. But in the last few decades, <span class="key" about="research">research</span> has shown that people can also have subjective <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>-like experiences in non-<span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span>, albeit less frequently and of a different nature. For example, a person thinking about a cat as they doze off into the first stage of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>—a hallucinatory state known as hypnagogia—may see strange cat visions and experience sensations such as falling. <span class="key" about="dream">Dreams</span> experienced later in <span class="key" about="non-REM sleep">non-REM sleep</span> tend to be more mundane and may involve people or objects that are familiar to the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span>. Once in very deep <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, people are more likely to have conceptual thoughts than to experience emotional narratives, if they have any memorable <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> at all.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation may have other uses in <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> manipulation, particularly for studying the relative roles of different brain regions in generating common <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> experiences. <span class="company" about="Queen Mary University of London">Queen Mary University of London</span>’s <span class="pers" about="Valdas Noreika">Valdas Noreika</span> and colleagues, for example, recently used 10-minute sessions of tDCS to disrupt activity in the sensorimotor cortex of 10 volunteers while they were in <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span>. The <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> woke people from <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span> shortly after each session, and asked them to fill out questionnaires on what they’d been <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> about—and specifically, whether they’d been engaged in movements such as lifting objects or walking. The results showed that people who had received tDCS reported experiencing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63479-6">less movement</a> in their <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> than people receiving a sham procedure, suggesting that normal sensorimotor cortex activity is required for those <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> sensations, <span class="pers" about="Valdas Noreika">Noreika</span> says. Specifically, <q>we found that this sensorimotor cortex is responsible for repetitive actions of the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> self . . . such as walking, running, swimming.</q></p>
			<p>Simpler technologies likely also have their place in the manipulation of <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> experiences. <span class="pers" about="Michelle Carr">Michelle Carr</span>, who did her PhD in <span class="pers" about="Tore Nielsen">Nielsen</span>’s lab and is now a postdoc at the <span class="company" about="University of Rochester">University of Rochester</span>, has been experimenting for the last couple of years with techniques to induce self-awareness in <span class="key" about="dream">dreamers</span> in a lab setting. She’s found that using behavioral training to get people to associate sensory stimuli such as lights or sounds with a sense of heightened awareness seems to be an effective way to trigger lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span>.</p>
			<p>In a recent study, for example, <span class="pers" about="Michelle Carr">Carr</span> and her colleagues trained awake volunteers to try to become particularly aware of their surroundings whenever <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> presented them with alternating cues of flashing red LEDs and a beeping noise. Participants subsequently were allowed 90 minutes to doze off for a nap in the lab, while <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> monitored their <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> stages using several techniques including EEG and measurements of electrical activity in the muscles. When a participant entered <span class="key" about="REM sleep"> REM sleep</span>, experimenters triggered the LED and the audio cues in the same alternating pattern they’d played during training. By monitoring eye movements for the agreed-upon eye-flicking signal, collecting <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports from people woken up by <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> for brief periods mid-nap, and administering questionnaires after the 90 minutes was up, the team found that around 50 percent of the treatment group <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-24631-001">experienced lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span></a>, compared with just 17 percent in a control group of participants who’d completed the training but hadn’t had the lights and sounds played to them during their naps. <q>It was really cool—some people did [the cue-signal response] up to eight times,</q> <span class="pers" about="Michelle Carr">Carr</span> says. <q>Some people who had never before had one had their first lucid <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> in the lab.</q></p>
			<p>While the <span class="key" about="research">research</span> is still in early stages, <span class="pers" about="Michelle Carr">Carr</span> says she hopes the findings will encourage further studies intended to trigger certain sensations in <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, with an eye toward the possible benefits. She and her colleagues recently analyzed <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> and mood diaries kept by 20 people over the course of a week and found that higher lucidity correlated with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020300301">elevated waking mood</a> the following day. The <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> plan to use their lucidity-inducing techniques to investigate whether the relationship is to some degree causal, <span class="pers" about="Michelle Carr">Carr</span> says, and whether inducing lucidity has other applications, such as helping people suffering from recurrent nightmares—a common symptom of many mental health conditions including anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
			<p><q>If we can get [these <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>] to be induced reliably,</q> Carr says, <q>then we can use them for beneficial purposes.</q></p>
			<span class="app"><h3 id="Incubation">Incubation of specific <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> content</h3></span>
			<p><span class="special">F</span>or some <span class="key" about="dream research">dream researchers</span>, it’s not just the overall <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> experience that’s worth manipulating, but also a <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>’s specific content. Many ancient human civilizations experimented with this idea too, and documented attempts to promote in-<span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> encounters with various deities, for example. But for Harvard’s <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span>, it was a family trip to <span class="pl" about="Vermont">Vermont</span> in the <span class="date" about="1990s">1990s</span> that made him start thinking about the idea.</p>
			<p>Falling <span class="key" about="sleep">asleep</span> one evening after a hike up <span class="pl" about="Camel’s Hump in the Green Mountains">Camel’s Hump in the Green Mountains</span>, <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span> was surprised to feel as though he were scrambling up the side of the mountain, just as he had earlier that day, with the distinct sensation of rocky ground under his hands. Waking up and then dozing off again, he found that he was able to regain this sensation several times before falling into a deeper <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>. Intrigued by the experience, <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span> says, he wondered about how to try to capture it in an experiment.</p>
			<p>There was a stumbling block, however: he’d be unlikely to obtain ethical and administrative approval to lead a gaggle of undergrads on a rock-climbing expedition just to see if they’d go on to <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> about the experience. It was only a few years later that an alternative presented itself. <q>I was in a meeting with a bunch of students one day, pissing and moaning about what a great experiment this would be, but how I would never be able to do it,</q> <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span> says. <q>One of the students sitting there just said, ‘What about Tetris?’ They proceeded to tell me that this happens when you start playing Tetris: you see [the pieces] floating down before your eyes.</q></p>
			<p>The conversation was the seed for what would become a famous study in <span class="key" about=" dream research">dream research</span>. <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span> and colleagues recruited 27 people—10 Tetris experts, 12 Tetris novices, and five patients with memory loss from brain damage—to play seven hours of the computer game over the course of three days. For an hour at the beginning of each night, participants were prompted by an experimenter or by a digitized voice recording to say what they were thinking about into a microcassette recorder or to an experimenter as they fell in and out of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>. Almost two-thirds of the participants reported <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>-like <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5490/350">visions of Tetris</a> during <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> onset, and three of the five amnesiacs also reported seeing Tetris-inspired imagery, despite having no conscious memory of the game. One described <q>thinking about little squares coming down on a screen and trying to put them in place,</q> while another said they’d seen <q>images that are turned on their side. I don’t know what they are from, I wish I could remember, but they are like blocks.</q> Several Tetris experts reported thinking not only of the Tetris they’d been playing during the experiment, but also of older versions of the game they’d played previously.</p>
			<p>Nudging the brain to incorporate specific content—a trick known as <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> incubation—has proven to be surprisingly practical using computer and virtual reality games. <span class="pers" about="Erin Wamsley">Erin Wamsley</span>, previously a postdoc with <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span>’s group who now runs a lab at <span class="company" about="Furman University">Furman University</span> in <span class="pl" about="South Carolina">South Carolina</span>, says that many <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> previously assumed <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> would be most influenced by more-intense experiences. <q>You can show someone horrible graphic images or very disturbing films with very high emotional content that participants would agree is disturbing or emotional,</q> says <span class="pers" about="Erin Wamsley">Wamsley</span>. <q>But [that’s] not something that triggers people to <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> directly about that experience, necessarily. On the other hand, we’ve had a lot of success causing participants to incorporate new learning experiences into their <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>.</q> <span class="pers" about="Erin Wamsley">Wamsley</span>’s now looking into what determines whether a particular experience will be incorporated into a <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>.</p>
			<span class="app"><h3 id="DreamEngineer">The <span class="key" about="dream">Dream</span> Engineer’s Toolbox</h3></span>
			<p><span class="special">R</span>esearchers use a variety of technologies to monitor (teal) and attempt to modulate (purple) people’s <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> experiences. While many protocols include pre-<span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> training—to encourage people to become more aware of their <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> selves, for example, or to incubate specific ideas using virtual reality or computer games—a number of <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>-influencing approaches can be applied during <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>. Scientists also monitor participants during <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> and collect <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports as soon as they awake.</p>

			<p>In <span class="date" about="2010">2010</span>, <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span>, <span class="pers" about="Erin Wamsley">Wamsley</span>, and colleagues got 43 volunteers to play an arcade skiing game called Alpine Racer. Around a third of the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports collected from subjects woken up from non-<span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span> over the following nights were <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/33/1/59/2454584">related to the game</a>. The nature of the <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> content changed as people fell into deeper <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, however, going from typical comments such as <q>I get like flashes of that . . . game in my head, virtual reality skiing game,</q> to oblique skiing references such as, <q>I was picturing stacking wood this time. . . . I felt like I was doing it at . . . a ski resort that I had been to before, like five years ago maybe.</q></p>
			<p>In the last couple of years, the same <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> have also used a simple maze navigation task that participants carry out on a computer to explore <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.12749">how content is incorporated</a> into <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> that occur during different <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> stages. A <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> report from someone just falling asleep contained thoughts of swimming above the maze, for example, while one participant woken from <span class="key" about="REM">REM sleep</span> reported <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> about walking through it. A typical report from later stages of <span class="key" about="non-REM sleep">non-REM sleep</span> involved the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span> just standing in the middle of a maze waiting for a friend to find them.</p>
			<p>This and many other studies have also reported an association between the incorporation of task content into <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> and task performance post-<span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>—a finding that adds weight to the prevalent view among <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> that <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>, and perhaps <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> specifically, plays an important role in memory consolidation. On the basis of current evidence, it’s not clear whether <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> helps drive that consolidation, or is perhaps instead a reflection or byproduct of the process. <span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span>, who explores theories of <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> with coauthor <span class="pers" about="Antonio Zadra">Antonio Zadra</span> in a new book, <span class="co">When Brains Dream</span>, slated for publication in January, hypothesizes that <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span> plays an active role in consolidating emotional memories and extracting patterns from recent experiences, and that perhaps the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamlike</span> visions of hypnagogia are the brain’s way of tagging relevant content for processing later on in the <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> cycle. Other <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> posit that <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> serve different functions—<span class="pers" about="Valdas Noreika">Noreika</span> is one of several scientists who think they offer simulation of potential threats and social interactions that the <span class="key" about="dream">dreamer</span> might encounter in waking life—or perhaps no function at all.</p>

			<p>Exploring potential functions of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> and <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> content is a key purpose of <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span>-influencing technologies such as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/targeted-dream-incubation/overview/">Dormio</a>, notes <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span>, who says that the device’s ability to interact with <span class="key" about="dream">dreamers</span> in real time offers the possibility of collecting data more easily compared to traditional <span class="key" about="dream research">dream research</span>, even if hypnagogia and <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span> aren’t exactly equivalent. He’s recently launched a number of collaborations, not only with <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> scientists curious about how changing <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> content could alter memory or learning, but also with artists and philosophers interested in how <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> incubation might boost their creativity.</p>

			<p><span class="special">C</span>arr, <span class="pers" about="Adam Haar Horowitz">Haar Horowitz</span>, and others organized a workshop at MIT last year for engineers and <span class="key" about="dream research">dream researchers</span> to discuss technologies available to the field, and the group put together a special issue of scientific papers on <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> engineering for the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/consciousness-and-cognition/special-issue/10M66P43FVH"><i>Consciousness and Cognition</i></a> this summer. <q>A lot of collaborations developed from that workshop,</q> says <span class="pers" about="Michelle Carr">Carr</span>, who was managing guest editor for the issue. <q>I think it’s the start of something new.</q></p>
			<p>With this momentum, <span class="key" about="dream research">dream researchers</span> are hopeful that their field will overcome a lingering image problem in <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> science. Even now, <q>a lot of people view <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> as a fringe topic, kind of like studying ESP [extrasensory perception] or out-of-body experiences,</q> says Wamsley. <q>Of course, in my opinion, it’s nothing like that at all. In our <span class="key" about="research">research</span> on <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span>, we treat studying <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> as another way to understand what the mind and brain are doing during <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>.<q></p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the subjectivity of self-reported <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span> remains an issue, she acknowledges. While neuroscientists’ attempts to objectively <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/notebook/decoding-dreams-39990">predict</a> what people are <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> about on the basis of brain imaging techniques such as functional MRI have made strides in the last few years, they’re a long way from matching the detail in <span class="key" about="dream">dreamers</span>’ own descriptions, she says. Aware of this obstacle, several groups working on <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> engineering seek to demonstrate the value and feasibility of collecting <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports as part of regular <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span> studies.</p>
			<p>In a recent study from <span class="pers" about="Björn Rasch">Björn Rasch</span>’s lab at the <span class="company" about="University of Fribourg">University of Fribourg</span> in <span class="pl" about="Switzerland">Switzerland</span>, for example, <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> trained people on a word-picture association task, and then subsequently woke them up for <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports during the night. The team found that people’s memory of the task the following morning didn’t seem to be affected by the awakenings themselves. The <span class="key" about="research">researchers</span> also reported that there was a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30091298/">positive relationship</a> between <span class="key" about="dream">dreaming</span> of the task during <span class="key" about="non-REM sleep">non-REM sleep</span> and memory performance the following morning, but they found no such association when it came to dreams of the task during <span class="key" about="REM sleep">REM sleep</span>—a clue about <span class="key" about="sleep">sleep</span>’s role in memory that would have been overlooked had <span class="key" about="dream">dream</span> reports not been gathered.</p>
			<p><span class="key" about="dream research">Dream researchers</span> are also looking toward some of the extraordinary implications of manipulating the minds of <span class="key" about="sleep">sleeping</span> people. With the prospect of devices such as Dormio allowing people to interface with their own or other people’s <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>, ethical considerations “are paramount here,” notes computer scientist Pattie Maes, the head of the Fluid Interfaces group at MIT’s Media Lab and a coauthor of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020300325">review</a> of the field in <i>Consciousness and Cognition</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="pers" about="Robert Stickgold">Stickgold</span> agrees, noting that even after having done it for decades, there’s something unique, and even unsettling, about interacting with the minds of people in the not-quite-conscious, not-quite-unconscious world of <span class="key" about="dream">dreams</span>. <q>It has an edge of scariness,</q> he says. <q>We’re tapping into an aspect of people’s minds that we don’t have much control over and they don’t have much control over when they’re <span class="key" about="sleep">sleeping</span>. We’re almost voyeurs, watching their minds do what they decide to do.<q></p>

            person’s <span class="key" about="mind">mind</span> and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid
            version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form. This futuristic possibility
            is
            called <span class="key" about="mind uploading">mind uploading</span>. The science of the brain and of consciousness increasingly suggests that <span class="key" about="mind uploading">mind
            uploading</span>
            is possible – there are no laws of physics to prevent it. The technology is likely to be far in our future;
            it
            may be centuries before the details are fully worked out – and yet given how much interest and effort is
            already
            directed towards that goal, <span class="key" about="mind uploading">mind uploading</span> seems inevitable. Of course we can’t be certain how it might
            affect
            our culture but as the technology of <span class="key" about="simulate">simulation</span> and artificial neural networks shapes
            up, we can guess what that
            <span class="key" about="mind uploading">mind uploading</span> future might be like.
            Suppose one day you go into an uploading clinic to have your brain scanned. Let’s be generous and pretend
            the
            technology works perfectly. It’s been tested and debugged. It captures all your synapses in sufficient
            detail to
            recreate your unique <span class="key" about="mind">mind</span>. It gives that <span class="key" about="mind">mind</span> a standard-issue, <span class="key" about="virtual">virtual</span> body that’s reasonably comfortable,
            with
            your face and voice attached, in a <span class="key" about="virtual">virtual</span> environment like a high-quality video game. Let’s pretend all of
            this
            has come true.

        <p class="par" id="2">Who is that second you?</p>
        <p class="par" id="3">The first you, let’s call it the biological you, has paid a
            fortune
            for the procedure. And yet you walk out of
            the clinic just as mortal as when you walked in. You’re still a biological being, and eventually you’ll die.
            As
            you drive home, you think: “Well, that was a waste of money.”</p>
        <p class="par" id="4">At the same time, the <span class="key" about="simulate">simulated</span> you wakes up in a <span class="key" about="virtual">virtual</span>

            continuity of experience. It remembers walking into the clinic, swiping a credit card, signing a waiver,
            lying
            on the table. It feels as though it was anaesthetised and then woke up again somewhere else. It has your
            memories, your personality, your thought patterns and emotional quirks. It sits up in a new bed and says: “I
            can’t believe it worked! Definitely worth the cost.”</p>

            everything
            is present – with less garbage though, and the rats are entirely sanitary and put in for local colour. You
            chat
            up strangers in a way you would never do in the real New York, where you’d be worried that an impatient

            You
            stop at a cafe and sip a latte. It doesn’t taste right. It doesn’t feel like anything is going into your

            don’t get dizzy, because there is no such thing as oxygen in this <span class="key" about="virtual">virtual</span> <span class="key" about="world">world</span>. You find yourself equipped
            with
            a complementary <span class="key" about="simulate">simulated</span> smartphone, and you call the number that used to be yours – the phone you had with

            lies a very real

            and sim you?</p>

        <p class="par" id="11">I prefer a geometric way of thinking about the situation. Imagine that your life is like
            the
            rising stalk of the
            letter Y. You’re born at the base, and as you grow up, your <span class="key" about="mind">mind</span> is shaped and changed along a trajectory.
            Then
            you let yourself be scanned, and from that moment on, the Y has branched. There are now two
                trajectories , each
            one equally and legitimately you. Let’s say the left-hand branch is the <span class="key" about="simulate">simulated</span> you and the right-hand
            branch
            is the biological you. The part of you that lives indefinitely is represented by both the stem of the Y and
            the
            left-hand branch. Just as your childhood self lives on in your adult self, the stem of the Y lives on in the
            <span class="key" about="simulate">simulated</span> self. Once the scan is over, the two branches of the Y proceed along different life paths,
            accumulating different experiences. The right-hand branch will die. Everything that happens to it after the
            branching point fails to achieve immortality – unless it chooses to scan itself again, in which case another
            branch appears, and the geometry becomes even more complicated.</p>
        <p class="par" id="12">What emerges is not a single you, but a topologically intricate version, a hyper you with
            two
            or more branches.
            One of those branches is always going to be mortal, and the others have an indefinite lifespan depending on
            how
            long the computer platform is maintained.</p>
        <p class="par" id="13">You might think that since the bio you lives in the real <span class="key" about="world">world</span>, and the sim you lives in
            a
            <span class="key" about="virtual">virtual</span> <span class="key" about="world">world</span>, the two
            will never meet and therefore should never encounter any complications from coexisting. But these days, who
            needs to meet in person? We interact mainly through electronic media anyway. The sim you and the bio you
            represent two fully functional, interactive, capable instances of you, competing within the same larger,
            interconnected, social and economic universe. You could easily find yourselves meeting over video
            conference. At
            the simplest level, <span class="key" about="mind uploading">mind uploading</span> would preserve people in an indefinite afterlife. Families could have
            Christmas dinner with sim Grandma joining in on video conference, the tablet screen propped up at the end of
            the
            table – presuming she has time for her bio family any more, given the rich possibilities in the <span class="key" about="simulate">simulated</span>
            playground. It’s this kind of idealised afterlife that people have in <span class="key" about="mind">mind</span>, when they think about the
            benefits
            of <span class="key" about="mind uploading">mind uploading</span>. It’s a human-made heaven.</p>
        <p class="par" id="14">But unlike a traditional heaven, it isn’t a separate <span class="key" about="world">world</span>. It’s seamlessly connected to
            the
            real <span class="key" about="world">world</span>. Think of
            how you interact with the <span class="key" about="world">world</span> right now. If you live the typical western lifestyle, then the smallest part
            of
            your life involves interacting with people in the physical space around you. Your connection to the larger <span class="key" about="world">world</span>
            is almost entirely through digital means. The news comes to you on a screen or through earbuds. Distant
            locations are real to you mainly because you learn about them through electronic media. Politicians,
            celebrities, even some friends and family may exist to you mainly through data. People work in <span class="key" about="virtual">virtual</span>
            offices
            where they know their colleagues only through video and text.</p>

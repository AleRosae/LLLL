        <p class="par" id="9">When these types of <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span> manipulations get discussed, several sci-fi scenarios come to

            Already, implanted electrodes can record signals from the movement areas of the <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span>, allowing people to

            These tools can

            But the power to precisely change a functioning <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span> directly — and as a result, a person’s behavior —
            raises

        <br>
        <p class="par" id="30">As <span class="key" about="neurotechnology">neurotechnology</span> marches ahead, scientists, <span class="key" about="ethics">ethicists</span>, companies and governments are
            looking for answers on
            how, or even whether, to regulate <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span> <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span>. For now, those answers depend entirely on who is asked.
            And
            they come against a backdrop of increasingly invasive <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> that we’ve become surprisingly comfortable
            with.</p>

        <p class="par" id="31">We allow our smartphones to monitor where we go, what time we fall asleep and even
            whether
            we’ve washed our hands
            for a full 20 seconds. Couple that with the digital breadcrumbs we actively share about the diets we try,
            the
            shows we binge and the tweets we love, and our lives are an open book.</p>

        <p class="par" id="32">Those details are more powerful than <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span> data, says <span class="pers" about="Anna Wexler">Anna
                Wexler</span>,
            an <span class="key" about="ethics">ethicist</span> at the

            <q>My e-mail address, my notes app and my search engine history are more reflective of who I am as a person
                —my
                identity — than our neural data may ever be,
            </q> she says.
        </p>
        <div class="Op-box">
            <p><q>How would we know that what we thought or felt came from our own <span class="key" about="brain">brains</span>, or whether it was put there
                    by someone else?</q></p>
        </div>
        <p class="par" id="33">It’s too early to worry about <span class="key" about="privacy">privacy</span> invasions from <span class="key" about="neurotechnology">neurotechnology</span>, <span
                class="pers" about="Anna Wexler">Wexler</span> argues, a
            position that makes her an
            outlier. <q>Most of my colleagues would tell me I’m crazy.</q></p>

        <p class="par" id="34">At the other end of the spectrum, some researchers, including <span
                class="pers" about="Rafael Yuste">Yuste</span>, have proposed strict
            regulations around
            <span class="key" about="privacy">privacy</span> that would treat a person’s neural data like their organs. Much like a liver can’t be taken out of a
            body without approval for medical purposes, neural data shouldn’t be removed either. That viewpoint has
            found
            purchase in <span class="place" about="Chile">Chile</span>, which is now considering whether to classify neural data with new protections that would
            not
            allow companies to get at it.</p>

        <p class="par" id="35">Other experts fall somewhere in the middle. <span class="pers" about="Marcello Ienca">Ienca</span>, for example,
            doesn’t want to see
            restrictions on personal
            freedom. People ought to have the choice to sell or give away their <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span> data for a product they like, or
            even
            for straight up cash. <q>The human <span class="key" about="brain">brain</span> is becoming a new asset,</q> <span class="pers" about="Marcello Ienca">Ienca</span>
            says,
            something that can generate profit
            for companies eager to mine the data. He calls it <q>neurocapitalism.</q></p>

        <p class="par" id="36">And <span class="pers" about="Marcello Ienca">Ienca</span> is fine with that. If a person is adequately informed
            —
            granted, a questionable if
            — then they are
            within their rights to sell their data, or exchange it for a service or product, he says. People ought to
            have
            the freedom to do what they like with their information.</p>

        <p class="par" id="37">General rules, checklists and regulations are not likely to be a good path forward,
            <span class="pers" about="Karen Rommelfanger">Rommelfanger</span> says. <q>Right
                now, there are over 20 frameworks, guidelines, principles that have been developed since 2014 on how to
                handle
                neuroscience,</q> she says. Those often cover “mental <span class="key" about="privacy">privacy</span>” and “cognitive liberty,” the freedom to control your
            own mental life.
        </p>

        <p class="par" id="38">Those guidelines are thoughtful, she says, but the technologies differ in what they’re
            capable of, and in their
            possible <span class="key" about="ethics">ethical</span> repurcussions. One-size-fits-all solutions don’t exist, <span
                class="pers" about="Karen Rommelfanger">Rommelfanger</span>
            says.</p>

        <p class="par" id="40">Moving forward on the <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> to help people with mental illness and paralysis is an

        <p class="par" id="41">A lack of <span class="key" about="ethics">ethical</span> clarity is unlikely to slow the pace of the coming neurotech rush. But

    <h1>What happens if our mind lives for ever on the internet?</h1>
    <h2>It may be some way off, but mind uploading, the digital duplication of your mental essence, could expand human
        experience into a virtual afterlife</h2>

    <p>Imagine that a person’s brain could be scanned in great detail and recreated in a computer simulation. The
        person’s mind and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid
        version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form. This futuristic possibility is
        called mind uploading. The science of the brain and of consciousness increasingly suggests that mind uploading
        is possible – there are no laws of physics to prevent it. The technology is likely to be far in our future; it
        may be centuries before the details are fully worked out – and yet given how much interest and effort is already
        directed towards that goal, mind uploading seems inevitable. Of course we can’t be certain how it might affect
        our culture but as the technology of simulation and artificial neural networks shapes up, we can guess what that
        mind uploading future might be like.
        Suppose one day you go into an uploading clinic to have your brain scanned. Let’s be generous and pretend the
        technology works perfectly. It’s been tested and debugged. It captures all your synapses in sufficient detail to
        recreate your unique mind. It gives that mind a standard-issue, virtual body that’s reasonably comfortable, with
        your face and voice attached, in a virtual environment like a high-quality video game. Let’s pretend all of this
        has come true.
    </p>
    <p>Who is that second you?</p>
    <p>The first you, let’s call it the biological you, has paid a fortune for the procedure. And yet you walk out of
        the clinic just as mortal as when you walked in. You’re still a biological being, and eventually you’ll die. As
        you drive home, you think: “Well, that was a waste of money.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, the simulated you wakes up in a virtual apartment and feels like the same old you. It has a
        continuity of experience. It remembers walking into the clinic, swiping a credit card, signing a waiver, lying
        on the table. It feels as though it was anaesthetised and then woke up again somewhere else. It has your
        memories, your personality, your thought patterns and emotional quirks. It sits up in a new bed and says: “I
        can’t believe it worked! Definitely worth the cost.”</p>

    <p>I won’t call it an “it” any more, because that mind is a version of you. We’ll call it the simulated you. This
        “sim” you decides to explore. You step out of your apartment into the sunlight of a perfect day and find a
        virtual version of New York City. Sounds, smells, sights, people, the feel of the sidewalk underfoot, everything
        is present – with less garbage though, and the rats are entirely sanitary and put in for local colour. You chat
        up strangers in a way you would never do in the real New York, where you’d be worried that an impatient
        pedestrian might punch you in the teeth. Here, you can’t be injured because your virtual body can’t break. You
        stop at a cafe and sip a latte. It doesn’t taste right. It doesn’t feel like anything is going into your
        stomach. And nothing is, because it isn’t real food and you don’t have a stomach. It’s all a simulation. The
        visual detail on the table is imperfect. There’s no grittiness to the rust. Your fingers don’t have fingerprints
        – they’re smooth, to save memory on fine detail. Breathing doesn’t feel the same. If you hold your breath, you
        don’t get dizzy, because there is no such thing as oxygen in this virtual world. You find yourself equipped with
        a complementary simulated smartphone, and you call the number that used to be yours – the phone you had with
        you, just a few hours ago in your experience, when you walked into the clinic.</p>
    <p>Now the biological you answers the phone.</p>
    <p>“Yo,” says the sim you. “It’s me. I mean, it’s you. What’s up?”</p>
    <p>“I’m depressed, that’s what. I’m in my apartment eating ice-cream. I can’t believe I spent all that money for
        zilch.”</p>
    <p>“Zilch?! You would not believe what it’s like in here! It’s a fantastic place. Remember Kevin, the guy who died
        of cancer last week? He’s here too! He’s fine, and he still has the same job. He Skypes with his old yoga studio
        three times a week, to teach his fitness class. But his girlfriend in the real world has left him for someone
        who’s not dead yet. Still, lots of new people to date here.”</p>
    <p>I have to resist getting carried away by the humour of the situation. Underneath the details lies a very real
        philosophical conundrum that people will eventually have to confront. What is the relationship between bio you
        and sim you?</p>

    <p>I prefer a geometric way of thinking about the situation. Imagine that your life is like the rising stalk of the
        letter Y. You’re born at the base, and as you grow up, your mind is shaped and changed along a trajectory. Then
        you let yourself be scanned, and from that moment on, the Y has branched. There are now two trajectories, each
        one equally and legitimately you. Let’s say the left-hand branch is the simulated you and the right-hand branch
        is the biological you. The part of you that lives indefinitely is represented by both the stem of the Y and the
        left-hand branch. Just as your childhood self lives on in your adult self, the stem of the Y lives on in the
        simulated self. Once the scan is over, the two branches of the Y proceed along different life paths,
        accumulating different experiences. The right-hand branch will die. Everything that happens to it after the
        branching point fails to achieve immortality – unless it chooses to scan itself again, in which case another
        branch appears, and the geometry becomes even more complicated.</p>
    <p>What emerges is not a single you, but a topologically intricate version, a hyper you with two or more branches.
        One of those branches is always going to be mortal, and the others have an indefinite lifespan depending on how
        long the computer platform is maintained.</p>
    <p>You might think that since the bio you lives in the real world, and the sim you lives in a virtual world, the two
        will never meet and therefore should never encounter any complications from coexisting. But these days, who
        needs to meet in person? We interact mainly through electronic media anyway. The sim you and the bio you
        represent two fully functional, interactive, capable instances of you, competing within the same larger,
        interconnected, social and economic universe. You could easily find yourselves meeting over video conference. At
        the simplest level, mind uploading would preserve people in an indefinite afterlife. Families could have
        Christmas dinner with sim Grandma joining in on video conference, the tablet screen propped up at the end of the
        table – presuming she has time for her bio family any more, given the rich possibilities in the simulated
        playground. It’s this kind of idealised afterlife that people have in mind, when they think about the benefits
        of mind uploading. It’s a human-made heaven.</p>
    <p>But unlike a traditional heaven, it isn’t a separate world. It’s seamlessly connected to the real world. Think of
        how you interact with the world right now. If you live the typical western lifestyle, then the smallest part of
        your life involves interacting with people in the physical space around you. Your connection to the larger world
        is almost entirely through digital means. The news comes to you on a screen or through earbuds. Distant
        locations are real to you mainly because you learn about them through electronic media. Politicians,
        celebrities, even some friends and family may exist to you mainly through data. People work in virtual offices
        where they know their colleagues only through video and text.</p>

    <p>Each of us might as well already be in a virtual world, with a steady flow of information passing in and out
        through CNN, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and text. We live in a kind of multiverse, each of us in a
        different virtual bubble, the bubbles occasionally merging in real space and then separating, but always
        connected through the global social network. If a virtual afterlife is created, the people in it, with the same
        personalities and needs that they had in real life, would have no reason to isolate themselves from the rest of
        us. Very little needs to change for them. Socially, politically, economically, the virtual and the real worlds
        would connect into one larger and always expanding civilisation. The virtual world might as well be simply
        another city on Earth, filled with people who have migrated to it.</p>
    <p>We’ve always lived in a world where culture turns over with each generation. But what happens when the older
        generations never die, but remain just as active in society? There’s no reason to think that the living will
        have any political, economic, or intellectual advantage over the simulated.</p>
    <p>Think of the jobs people have in our world. Many of them require physical action, and those are the jobs that
        will probably be replaced by automatons. Taxi driver? Publicly shared, self-driving cars are almost here. Street
        cleaners? Checkout operators? Construction workers? Pilots? All of these jobs are probably for the chopping
        block in the medium to long term. Robotics and artificial intelligence will take them over. The rest of our
        jobs, our contributions to the larger world, are done through the mind, and if the mind can be uploaded, it can
        keep doing the same job. A politician can work from cyberspace just as well as from real space. So can a
        teacher, or a manager, or a therapist, or a journalist, or the guy in the complaints department.</p>

    <p>The CEO of a company, a Steve Jobs type who has shaped up a sweet set of neural connections in his brain that
        makes him exceptional at his work, can manage from a remote, simulated office. If he must shake hands, he can
        take temporary possession of a humanoid robot, a kind of shared rent-a-bot, and spend a few hours in the real
        world, meeting and greeting. Even calling it the “real” world sounds prejudicial to me. Both worlds would be
        equally real. Maybe the better term is the “foundation” world and the “cloud” world.</p>
    <p>The foundation world would be full of people who are mere youngsters – mainly under the age of 80 – who are still
        accumulating valuable experience. Their unspoken responsibility would be to gain wisdom and experience before
        joining the ranks of the cloud world. The balance of power and culture would shift rapidly to the cloud. How
        could it not? That’s where the knowledge, experience and political connections will accumulate. In that
        scenario, the foundation world becomes a kind of larval stage for immature minds, and the cloud world is where
        life really begins. Mind uploading could transform our culture and civilisation more profoundly than anything in
        our past.</p>

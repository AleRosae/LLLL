		<p>The only thing we’d wanted to do was ensure that <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> could make some money and have control over their work. Back in <span class="date" about="May 2014">May 2014</span>, I was <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2021/mar/03/another-new-world/">paired up with the artist <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">Kevin McCoy</span></a> at Seven on Seven, an annual event in <span class="pl" about="New York City">New York City</span> designed to spark new ideas by connecting technologists and <span class="key" about="art">artists</span>. I wasn’t sure which one I was supposed to be; <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> and his wife, <span class="pers" about="Jennifer McCoy">Jennifer</span>, were already renowned for their collaborative <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> art, and he was better at coding than I was.</p>

		<p>At the time, I was working as a consultant to auction houses and media companies—a role that had me obsessively thinking about the provenance, ownership, distribution, and control of <span class="key" about="art">artworks</span>. Seven on Seven was modeled after <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span>-industry hackathons, in which people stay up all night to create a working prototype that they then show to an audience. This was around the peak of <span class="company" about="Tumblr">Tumblr</span> culture, when a raucous, wildly inspiring community of millions of <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> and fans was sharing images and videos completely devoid of attribution, compensation, or context. As it turned out, some of the <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span>s' works were among those being widely “reblogged” by Tumblr users. And <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">Kevin</span> had been thinking a lot about the potential of the then-nascent <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>—essentially an indelible ledger of <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> transactions—to offer <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> a way to support and protect their creations.</p>
		<p>By the wee hours of the night, <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> and I had hacked together a first version of a <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>-backed means of asserting ownership over an original <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> work. Exhausted and a little loopy, we gave our creation an ironic name: monetized graphics. Our <a href="https://vimeo.com/96131398?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosedge&stream=business">first live demonstration</a> was at the <span class="pl" about="New Museum of Contemporary Art">New Museum of Contemporary Art</span>> in <span class="pl" about="New York City">New York City</span>, where the mere phrase monetized graphics prompted knowing laughter from an audience wary of corporate-sounding intrusions into the creative arts. <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> used a <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> called Namecoin to register a video clip that his wife had previously made, and I bought it with the four bucks in my wallet.</p>
		<p>We didn’t patent the basic idea, but for a few years <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> tried to popularize it, with limited success. Our first demo might just have been ahead of its time. The system of verifiably unique <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> <span class="key" about="art">artworks</span> that we demonstrated that day in <span class="date" about="2014">2014</span> is now making headlines in the form of non-fungible tokens, or <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>, and it’s the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-21/nfts-mushroom-into-billion-dollar-market-with-help-from-alchemy?sref=BGQFqz7X">basis of a billion-dollar market</a>. Head-spinning prices are now being paid for <span class="key" about="art">artworks</span> that, just a few months ago, would have been mere curiosities. Last week, <span class="pers" about="Kevin Roose">Kevin Roose</span>, a <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> writer for <span class="company" about="The New York Times">The New York Times</span>, offered a <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> image of his column for sale in a charity auction, and a pseudonymous buyer paid the equivalent of $560,000 in cryptocurrency for it. <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> has <a href="https://www.axios.com/nft-sale-art-blockchain-millions-90238222-e702-4df2-a24f-1f7256ec3809.html">just put up for sale</a> the very first<span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> we created while building our system. Capturing an animation called Quantum, it could go for $7 million or more, Axios reports.</p>
		<p>I have no financial stake in that sale. The only <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> I own is the one I bought for $4, and I have no plans to sell it. I certainly didn’t predict the current <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> mania, and until recently had written off our project as a footnote in internet history.</p>
		<p>The idea behind <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> was, and is, profound. <span class="key" about="technology">Technology</span> should be enabling <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> to exercise control over their work, to more easily sell it, to more strongly protect against others appropriating it without permission. By devising the <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> specifically for artistic use, <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> and I hoped we might prevent it from becoming yet another method of exploiting creative professionals. But nothing went the way it was supposed to. Our dream of empowering <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> hasn’t yet come true, but it has yielded a lot of commercially exploitable hype.</p>
		<p>The idea behind <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> was, and is, profound. <span class="key" about="technology">Technology</span> should be enabling <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> to exercise control over their work, to more easily sell it, to more strongly protect against others appropriating it without permission.

But nothing went the way it was supposed to. Our dream of empowering <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> hasn’t yet come true, but it has yielded a lot of commercially exploitable hype.</p>
		<p>If you liked an <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span>, would you pay more for it just because someone included its name in a spreadsheet? I probably wouldn’t. But once you leave aside the technical details of <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>, putting <span class="key" about="art">artworks</span> on the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> is like listing them in an auction catalog. It adds a measure of certainty about the work being considered. By default, copies of a <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> image or video are perfect replicas—indistinguishable from the original down to its bits and bytes. Being able to separate an artist’s initial creation from mere copies confers power, and in <span class="date"about="2014">2014</span> it was genuinely new.</p>
		<p>But the <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> prototype we created in a one-night hackathon had some shortcomings. You couldn’t store the actual <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span> in a <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>; because of technical limits, records in most blockchains are too small to hold an entire image. Many people suggested that rather than trying to shoehorn the whole <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span> into the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>, one could just include the web address of an image, or perhaps a mathematical compression of the work, and use it to reference the <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span> elsewhere.</p>

		<p>We took that shortcut because we were running out of time. Seven years later, all of today’s popular <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> platforms still use the same shortcut. This means that when someone buys an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span>, they’re not buying the actual <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span>; they’re <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122">buying a link to it</a>. And worse, they’re buying a link that, in many cases, lives on the website of a new start-up that’s likely to fail within a few years. Decades from now, how will anyone verify whether the linked <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span> is the original?</p>
		<p>All common <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> platforms today share some of these weaknesses. They still depend on one company staying in business to verify your art. They still depend on the old-fashioned pre-<span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> internet, where an <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span> would suddenly vanish if someone forgot to renew a domain name. “Right now <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them,” the software engineer Jonty Wareing <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372170724459343874?s=20">recently wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>
		<p>But the situation gets worse. Over the past decade, the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> has become a refuge for people who need another place to rest their assets. For global tycoons, it’s just an alternative to parking their money in some real estate they would never visit. They can leave money in <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>-based cryptocurrencies instead, which appreciate in value as long as people buy up bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and the like faster than the overall supply increases. Within the <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> industry, a second group of investors hopes to use blockchains to build new apps, in areas such as social media or e-commerce, that <a href="https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2018/03/28/blockchain-will-disrupt-google-apple-amazon-facebook/">bypass <span class="company" about="Google">Google</span>, <span class="company" about="Facebook">Facebook</span>, <span class="company" about="Amazon">Amazon</span>, <span class="company" about="Apple">Apple</span>, and other <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> giants</a>. Instead of giving a cut of their revenue to the App Store, for example, these investors want to build new lines of business in which they can keep the whole pie for themselves.</p>
		<p>One major challenge is that the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> has, at present, approximately zero uses for the typical consumer. Theoretical uses abound, but no ordinary person is choosing a <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>-based <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> over its traditional counterpart. More than a decade after blockchains first caught <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> geeks’ eye, not a single smartphone app that you use with friends or co-workers relies on that <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span>. By contrast, when the web was the same age that bitcoin is today, it had <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/">half a billion users</a> around the world.</p>
		<p>There’s only one exception to the lack of interest in <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> apps today: apps for trading cryptocurrencies themselves. What results is an almost hermetically sealed economy, whose currencies exist only to be traded and become derivatives of themselves. If you squint, it looks like an absurd art project.</p>
		<p>After a decade of whiplash-inducing changes in valuation, billions of dollars are now invested in cryptocurrencies, and the people who have made those bets can’t cash in their chips anywhere. They can’t buy real estate with cryptocurrency. They can’t buy yachts with it. So the only rich-person hobby they can partake in with their cryptowealth is buying art. And in this art market, no one is obligated to have any taste or judgment about art itself. If <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> prices suddenly plunge, these investors will try buying polo horses or Davos tickets with cryptocurrencies instead. Think of a kid who’s spent the day playing Skee-Ball and now has a whole lot of tickets to spend. Every toy looks enticing. <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> have become just such a plaything.</p>
		<p>The most common criticism of <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> is that they’re wildly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change">environmentally irresponsible</a>. Each transaction or recording of an <span class="key" about="art">artwork</span> requires more and more computing power to complete. More computing power means more resources consumed. Many enthusiasts today will respond that “clean” or “green” <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> are already starting to circulate. But the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> and cryptocurrency enthusiasts of the past decade have shown that environmental responsibility is less than an afterthought. No evidence suggests that cryptotraders will make more money by embracing green <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>.</p>
		<p>Since the day he and I first teamed up to work on the <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span>, <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">Kevin McCoy</span> has been the authority on <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> for me. He is more responsible for the concept than any other person, and he told me recently that he believes green <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> will succeed. I want to believe him.</p>
		<p>As an artist you might ask yourself, <q>I need to make $100K a year to survive, what can I do that will have the least harm?</q>And I’m telling you right now, if you can sell 20 <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span>’s for $5k that’s a better alternative for the environment than having a merch store selling print on demand clothes and objects.</p>
		<p>But I also look at the history of other gold rushes. People usually choose short-term profit over long-term responsibility. Although I absolutely see lots of <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> who care deeply about the impact of their work, I don’t see broad support from the cryptorich for abandoning the devastatingly destructive <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> that brought them this far. I’m convinced by the artist and coder Everest Pipkin, whose <a href="https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3">comprehensive overview of the environmental and ethical pitfalls</a> bears this straightforward headline: <q>here is the article you can send to people when they say ‘but the environmental issues with cryptoart will be solved soon, right?</q></p>
		<p>In the meantime, the current <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> market is drawing an <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/03/11/nfts-crypto-grifters-try-to-scam-artists-again/">extraordinary range of grifters and spammers</a>. People are creating <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> of <span class="key" about="art">artists</span>’ works without asking permission or even letting the <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> know. Today, I run a platform that helps people create apps. Typically, the most popular apps are prosaic—messaging systems for work, or tools for building a website. For the entire first week of March, our most popular offering each day was a <span class="company" about="Twitter">Twitter</span> app that let people block lists of users en masse. The app skyrocketed in popularity because <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> were using it to block <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> spammers from hijacking their works and monetizing them as <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> without permission. </p>
		<p>Mainstream brands see their own opportunity to capitalize on the hype. Companies selling <a href="https://twitter.com/Charmin/status/1372157127280766981">toilet paper</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Pringles/status/1372555436398936068">potato chips</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/michelobultra/status/1373990574899007492">light beer</a> are tailgating on <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>’ newfound popularity to offer incomprehensible <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>-themed promotions on social media.</p>
		<p>I don’t want to let go of the optimistic ideal behind <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>. <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> still believes that <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> <span class="key" about="technology">technologies</span> can help <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> sustain their work. But in my work as a technologist, my optimism has been dashed many times by opportunists who rushed in after a <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> took off. In the early days of <span class="key" about="digital">digital</span> music, the advent of MP3s and new distribution systems was supposed to allow <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> to sell directly to fans. In the early days of social media, companies made blogging technologies with the promise that writers would be able to communicate directly with their readers. This pattern played out in industry after industry.</p>
		<p>Our initial <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> demo in <span class="date" about="2014">2014</span> was so well received that <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> and I were invited to present the <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> again a week or two later—this time at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, one of the <span class="key" about="technology">technology</span> industry’s highest-profile conferences. The crowd was a mix of <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> geeks and corporate types, all eager to spot the next hot start-up or popular smartphone app. <span class="pers" about="Kevin McCoy">McCoy</span> and I gave a slightly more polished demo of how our proto-<span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> could help <span class="key" about="art">artists</span>. Just like at the art museum, we made fun of our own phrase, monetized graphics. This time, nobody in the audience laughed. In the <span class="key" about="tech">tech</span> world, monetizing innovations is no joke. It’s how the industry operates, and this crowd was all business.</p>

<p>You may have been hearing a lot about <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>. Maybe it’s because the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span> known as <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/beeple"> <span class="pers" about="Mike Winkelmann">Beeple</span></a> sold an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> for $69 million. Or the DJ <span class="pers" about="Justin Blau">3La</span> <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT-izing</span> his album and making more than $10 million off it. Even the <span class="pers" about="Caleb Followill, Jared Followill, Matthew Followill, Nathan Followill">Kings of Leon</span> — for those too young to remember, they’re a Southern-rock group that had a moment in the early aughts and is <a href="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/KOL-2020-03-11-0001-RGB-1392x884.jpg">now full of balding dudes in their late 30s</a> — released their new album, “<span class="co" about="When You See Yourself">When You See Yourself</span>,” as an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span>.</p>
<p>So it’s a good time to know what an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> is and how it works and why it’s a lot more important than a few people becoming overnight rich people.</p>

<span class="app"><h3 id="WTFisAnNFT">What the eff is an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span>, really?</h3></span>
<p><span class="special">A</span>n <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> is a crypto asset. It’s not a currency you can use to buy things; instead, it lets you use the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> to authenticate something — like a piece of <span class="key" about="art">art</span>, or an X-ray of someone’s teeth. (That’s real; see below!)</p>
<p>
But what is it really? Let’s break it down by its letters. The T stands for <span class="key" about="token">token</span>. A <span class="key" about="token">token</span> incentivizes participants (miners, node operators, users, etc.) to support the chain's operations. Strictly speaking, it's just an individual unit programmed in the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>'s code. (It's OK if you don't know what that means; <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/what-is-blockchain">here's our guide</a>.) The NF stands for non-fungible. Fungible is a fancy word that means a unit of something that's interchangeable. Ethereum and Bitcoin (or Canadian dollars), for instance, are fungible, which means each one is pretty much the same as any other. Something that’s non-fungible is, on the other hand, not interchangeable. It's unique. Which means it's not very useful as common currency, but it is very useful for making sure something is real and one-of-a-kind because the transaction history is on the open ledger on the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>.</p>

<p>Anyone can create an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> on a blockchain that’s open, like <a href="https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/360056581534">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<span class="app"><h3 id="collectibles">It’s used for collectibles.</h3></span>
<p><span class="special">A</span>gain, an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> isn’t like a dollar bill, where if I give you a dollar and you give me a dollar, we both have the same thing: one dollar. Instead, it authenticates a specific item that cannot be reproduced.</p>
<p>In the physical world, certifiably unique things are often called “collectibles.” It’s easy to see why both individuals and large corporations (especially in the entertainment industry) might want to segment their product into a series of <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>. The biggest and best example of this is the <span class="company" about="NBA">NBA</span>, whose TopShot program allows fans to buy individual highlights and “own” them forever. Highlights, by definition, can have no physical form, but they are constantly, perpetually being created. They are self-generating collectibles, like your old baseball cards, only infinite. And as <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> they are more secure and less likely to be eroded by weather or time.</p>
<p><span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> are a reminder that it’s often not the quality of the <span class="key" about="art">art</span> or the collectibles that makes them valuable, it’s their uniqueness.</p>

<span class="app"><h3 id="youCanBuy">You can buy <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> all over the place.</h3></span>
<p><span class="special">I</span>t’s actually harder to buy physical <span class="key" about="art">art</span>, in the real world, than you might think. When’s the last time you went to <span class="company" about="Sotheby">Sotheby</span>’s? But <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> are democratizing the way valuable things are sold so they’re available everywhere, to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of where you live or who you know. Marketplaces like <a href="https://zora.co/">Zora</a>, <a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">CryptoPunks</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/">Opensea</a> and <a href="https://foundation.app/">Foundation</a> are some of them. Developers like Dapper Labs will sell you Cryptokitties (the original <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> crossover circa <span class="date" about="2017">2017</span> — they’re digital cats you can collect) or <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/blockchain-trading-cards">NBA TopShot</a> (the contemporary version of trading cards). If you’re into gaming, <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> will sell you in-game assets as <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>. If you want virtual real estate, <a href="https://decentraland.org/"><span class="company" about="Decentraland">Decentraland</span> and The Sandbox</a> are easier to use than local real estate brokers and you’ll never have to hear the phrase “sun-drenched eat-in-kitchen.”</p>
<span class="app"><h3><span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> often benefit <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> more than physical <span class="key" about="art">art</span> does.</h3></span>
<p><span class="key" about="NFT"><span class="special">N</span>FTs</span> have proven particularly popular among the <span class="key" about="art">arts</span> because they allow someone to own, specifically, something that can otherwise be shared by anyone. This is why simply making a copy of that <span class="pers" about="Grimes">Grimes</span> video and claiming ownership of it is as ridiculous as making a printout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler%27s_Mother">“<span class="co" about="Whistler’s Mother">Whistler’s Mother</span>,”</a> taping it to your wall and then saying you own it.</p>

<p>Another key is that the <span class="key" about="art">art</span> is sold by the creator, or the source. The only person who can verify its initial authenticity is the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span> themselves. (You can fake a <span class="pers" about="Pablo Picasso">Picasso</span> to all but the most-trained accessors.) But the NFT, and the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span> behind it, makes fooling anyone impossible. And there’s often way more upside for the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span>. Since the work is connected to the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span> on the <span class="key" about="blockchain">blockchain</span>, the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span> often gets a percentage of any secondary sales as a work of <span class="key" about="art">ar</span> goes up in value. If you bought a <span class="pers" about="Jean-Michel Basquiat">Basquiat</span> for pennies and sold it for millions, the <span class="key" about="art">artist</span> (or his estate) never got a cent of that secondary sale. That’s not the case with <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>. It’s a way for <span class="key" about="art">artists</span> to benefit more from the value of their <span class="key" about="art">art</span>, instead of just rich collectors.</p>
<span class="app"><h3 id="RealImportance">But the real importance of <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> isn’t what they are; it’s what they can become.</h3></span>
<p><span class="special">B</span>azillion-dollar meme cats and trading <span class="pers" about="LeBron James">LeBron</span> dunks are fun, but they’re not really the point. <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span> promise to change the way ownership works, the way buying and selling works, and it promises to change who benefits from commerce.</p>
<p>With an <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span>, any asset can become “<span class="key" about="token">tokenized</span>.” That means it can’t be copied or reproduced for free. It means that there’s a clear chain of ownership. And in the future, it could mean that power will be taken out of the hands of gatekeepers (banks, record labels, platforms) and given to creators (game developers, <span class="key" about="art">artists</span>). Imagine a world where all songs are <span class="key" about="token">tokenized</span>, so every <span class="key" about="art">artist</span> got paid for every stream of that song without needing Spotify. Imagine a world where physical assets — real estate, luxury goods, etc. — can be represented by <span class="key" about="NFT">NFTs</span>. That might mean you could borrow against your house without having to get it appraised or fill out a bunch of forms and paying middlemen who don’t do much.</p>
<span class="app"><h3 id="warning">In the meantime a warning: remember baseball cards.
</h3></span>
<p><span class="special">T</span>his future isn’t here quite yet. While the <span class="key" about="art">art</span>, or the <span class="pers" about="Grimes">Grimes</span> song, or the Shatner teeth, or the <span class="pers" about="LeBron James">LeBron</span> dunk, may be unique on its own merits, the idea of buying and selling these things, to create this market for each of them, could very well end up flooded. That is actually what happened to baseball cards after their explosion in the <span class="date" about="90s">‘90s</span>. Certain cards, the most-valuable cards, retained their value. But the market itself imploded with overloaded supply. The greater the flood of unique items entering the market, the less unique they seem. The <span class="key" about="NFT">NFT</span> market feels like a gold rush right now, but if there is an endless supply of gold… how can gold stay valuable? It’s possible your shiny new <span class="key" about="token">token</span>>won’t seem young and fresh anymore. It’ll start to look old and balding. And you could end up wondering why you just spent all that money to own a <span class="pers" about="Caleb Followill, Jared Followill, Matthew Followill, Nathan Followill">Kings of Leon</span> song no one else even knows.</p>

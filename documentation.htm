        <h2>The framework</h2>
        <p>This website allows users to read issues containing three different articles and perform some interesting operations on them. The two main scopes of the site are the following: displaying articles of a certain issue with different styles and layouts each heavily influenced by real typographic movements, and to perform cross analysis of textual metadata. </p>
        <p>In order to achieve these two results, Ajax has been implemented. I have created a main Ajax structure using jQuery that automatically and dynamically creates paths for the available issues. Inside each issue the user can decide to read independently each article. Dependent on the number of articles displayed (with a maximum of three per issue), the main container changes size accordingly (always allowing for independent scrolling). The Ajax here is used to retrieve information about each article from a .json file which contains plenty of information. </p>
        <p>Metadata are also display automatically with jQuery. In the same .json file there are various metadata that we believe are interesting for the readers, and the script is able to retrieve them and put them in their relative position. Then it is also possible to retrieve and display metadata information regarding the actual text of the articles. By clicking on different checkbox on the left sidebar, users can retrieve information from the text, for instance asking the system who has been mentioned in the article. For doing so, a mix of JavaScript and HTMK markup has been implemented. </p>
        <h2>The themes</h2>
        <h3 id="1920">1920s - The industrial revolution is here!</h3>
        <h4 data-toc-skip>Background</h4>
        <p>Costructivsm was an artistic and architectural movement that started in Russia at the beginning of the XX
          century. The term Construction Art was first used as a derisive term by Kazimir Malevich to describe the work
          of Alexander Rodchenko in 1917, but Constructivism as theory and practice was derived later at the Institute
          of Artistic Culture (INKhUK) in Moscow around 1920s. Constructivist architecture and art had a great effect on
          modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements.
          Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, sculpture, graphic design, industrial
          design, theatre, film, dance, fashion and, to some extent, music.</p>
        <p>With its abstract and austere philosophy, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and
          urban space] The movement rejected decorative stylization in favour of the industrial assemblage of materials,
          trying to recreate what the industrial field could be translated in art. It goes without any saying that
          Costructvism is deeply interrelated with the societal and political context of the soviet regime of that time.
          Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes, and were associated with Soviet
          socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde.</p>
        <h4 data-toc-skip>The layout</h4>
        <p>Most of the costructivism works were aimed at creating artworks and posters that somehow spread the message
          of the soviet propaganda. For this reason, some abstracting and reworking were required in order to adapt this
          style in the context of a typographical style for articles. Overall, the main feature of this typographical style is a hard, rigid structure: no rounded borders were allowed, the whole visual has to be stricly rectangular with very significan black borders.</p>
          <p>The first thing that should capture the reader
          attention is the main title: printed with an bold and large font, taking most of the main cover page should really
          give the feeling of a shout-out statement. For this reason, we have large font size for the title (rigorously
          in uppercase letters), while the ratio between the font size of the title and the font size of the main text
          is not less than an half (i.e. 0,5em). In order to reproduce the feeling of a poster, the whole text of the
          main body has been rendered in small caps. For what it concerns the font family, I used two complementary fonts that were developed by the same person (<a href="https://www.fontspace.com/neogrey-creative">Neogrey Creative</a>). Both Konstruktor and Red October aim at recreating the spirit of the soviet Russia, somehow mimicking the Cyrillic alphabet but still maintaining readability for western languages.</p>
        <p>Secondary, no fancy images are allowed in the cover page! This is the soviet revolution after all. The
          fancy and capitalistic images that usually cover the non-socialistic magazines have been replaced with a
          stylised artwork that represents the industrial work. This is not only an aesthetical element, but it is also
          a very symbolic element: art is not more than something that can be industrially created. Regarding symbolism, authors have been displaying along hammers that represent the hard work that each comrade puts in their writing, highlighting the factory-feeling of every form of art. 
        </p>
        <p>In order to recreate the feeling of a soviet poster, sharp and bold black lines have been drawn to “frame”
          the whole content and to divide the main sections of the article i.e. to separate the cover and the article
          body and to subdivide the hierarchy of the text (h3, h4, h5 and h6). The main title is cantered with a
          significant padding both to the right and to the left, while the text has an slighly asymmetric padding more
          consistent to the right than to the left (cf. sources for some visual example). Additional focuse was put for blockquotes boxes,
          which are again slightly rotated to the left and for lists, which uses a small triangle to indicate an
          unordered list (no numerical order is allowed!). An eventually ordered list would be automatically rendered as an
          unordered one because it would not fit the rationale of the time. Links have been displayed in slighly heavier font with a contrasting colour (i.e. cream). </p>
        <h4 data-toc-skip>The colours</h4>
        <p>Three main colours were used for the articles: red (#ce2909), black (#212528) and white (#f1f5dc). Red is probably the most
          important one, both for its huge impact on the screen and for its obvious political meaning. I have decided to
          play with the double contrast of white on red and black on red. This should recreate the feeling of the
          posters of that time (cf. sources). Moreover, the rest of the page has been painted with a opacque green that is perfect to render all the differnt parts of the layout.</p>

        <h3 id="2030">2030 – The future now</h3>
        <h4 data-toc-skip>Background</h4>
        <p>The current year is 2030. The COVID-19 pandemics is just a bad memory in people’s mind. Despite many efforts,
          the world is still having huge impact on the ecological climate of the planet Earth, humans still heavily rely
          on carbon fossil and a true green revolution has not yet happened. Statal entities like national governments
          are slowly but certainly declining due to the impact of breakthrough in the blockchain technologies that allow
          citizen to exchange money and stipulating contracts without third parties’ approval. Asian countries are now
          leaders in most of the pivotal fields of currently economy and Chinese is becoming the first spoken language
          for business and scientific research. For the everyday life of a normal citizen, the world of a 2030 human
          being is pretty similar to the one of a 2021’s one. So how web technology evolved in the meantime?</p>
        <p>The 2010s where undoubtedly the era of the smartphone as a every-day device for almost all the possible
          tasks. Despite being basically subclassed on the daily usage, desktop computers and notebook were still
          fundamental for many tasks, primarily due the screen size and the presence of mouse/keyboard for input. At the
          beginning of the 2020s, the development of foldable devices started to take place and brought some important
          new features for their users. First of all, it allowed to create hybrid devices that could be used as normal
          smartphones in their folded mode and as proper notebook in their un-folded mode. The advantages of such
          interoperability basically declared the death of computers as we have known them.</p>
        <p>Secondary, the traditional economy as we know it has been drastically changed by the advent of the blockchain
          technology and the rise of the cryptocurrency. People are now able to buy most of their goods, both outside
          and inside the internet, using a wide range of different crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and so
          on. They have their own crypto-wallet which can be used to rapidly exchange traditional currency (e.g. euros,
          dollars, etc.) with any kind of cryptocurrency and also to perform exchange between the latter. When browsing
          a particular item on the internet, they can decide to by the relative Non-Fungible Token (NFT) i.e. a sort of
          virtual copy of that resource that has a unique identifier. This has been an incredibly useful resource for
          online magazines that were struggling for funds.</p>
        <h4 data-toc-skip>The layout</h4>
        <p>In the context that was briefly laid out above, the layout of a web page should follow some minimalistic but
          fundamental rules. First of all, the text should be put at the very centre of the page in order to allow total
          readability of a user that is browsing thought a device in what is now refer to as “portrait mode”. This means
          an aspect ratio of 18/9 or 19.5/9 that exploit the vertical dimension in order to scroll the content. For this
            reason the text is put with a padding of 5px on the top, 25px on the left, 5px on the bottom and 25px on the right. Secondary, each line is separated by a wide
            blank space i.e. a line height of 2. This creates a very minimalist and clear visual
            that enhances readability. All the columns occupy only the 80% of the whole space; this has been achieved by setting both a right and left margin of 10%. To achieve a modern visual almost all the elements have rounded borders, similarly to the currents trends (cf. for instance Android 12 previews) and slight shadows that make them more credible. </p>
        <p>There is also a sharp distinction between the cover page, which includes title, subtitle, description and a
          cover image, and the actual body of the text. The first letter of the article is showcased by increase its
          size, a trick that is commonly used in most of current journals and which I believe will stick around for a
          while in the future. Except for that, there is no need for further decorations: the cover page has a
          minimalistic gradient background that gives a fresh-looking style to the page, but all the focus in on the
          text. For this reason, the choice of a good font that is clear, elegant and at the same time easy to ready, is
          crucial. My choice was on Raleway, for its being already used in many important magazines and for its
          minimalistic aspect and Roboto, for similar reasons. </p>
          <p>There are also some important features that are not stricly related to the visual aspect but to the web technologies of the future. First of all, a banner informs the user that he/she is using an old device to browse the content, which precludes some important feature as animated advertising (implying this is a bad thing, N.d.A.) and the possibility of listeting automatically to the whole text bly clicking on the icon positioned in the cover. The user is also allowed to buy the NFT version of the issue simply by inserting their univocal Wallet ID; but I suspect that none of us currently have one.</p>
          <p> Finally, the most important feature is the night/mode switch. By clicking on the moon icon the user can switch between two different version of the typographical style: one for the daylight and one for the nighttime. They are identical for what it concerns layout displaying, but they drastically change regarding colours. the nighttime view has a dark background and a white colour for the text, which drastically improve readability and helps user's eyes to rest. The nighttime view is starting to spread in many devices, but it is still uncommon to see that functionality on an actual web page (usually it is set as a device setting). I believe that being able to rapidaly switch between the two modes will be a popular trend in the near future.</p>
        <h4 data-toc-skip>The colours</h4>
        <p>For what it concerns the colour choice, I followed the line of simplicity: the text is plain black while the
          background is plain white. For the cover page a gradient looked like the best choice in order to preseverve a
          minimalistic aspect but also to give an aesthetically pleasant look. As it was mentioned above, the idea is to
          enhance as much as possible readability without distracting the reader. The only proper decoration that was
          developed it is related to anchors. They are displayed without underling or any other decorations, but when hoovered the anchors
          display a linear gradient change on the horizontal axes, giving the feeling of something “getting started”.

          <h3 id="1300">1300 - The Illuminated manuscript era</h3>
          <h4 data-toc-skip>Background</h4>
          <p>The Middle Age, often mistakenly thought of as a dark, uncultured age, saw the diffusion of a peculiar way of disseminating culture: the handwritten copying of texts. During this time, inside the lively context of convents and universities, copyists were busy preserving the cultural heritage of ancient civilisations (many texts from Greek and Roman philosophers survived to these days thanks to these people) and passing down important religious texts. </p>
          <p>Alongside the mission of preserving and transmitting culture, the period saw the birth of the art of illuminated manuscripts: handwritten books that have been decorated (illuminated) with gold, silver, or brilliant colours. Illuminations may include small illustrations (called miniatures), initials, borders, or other decorative elements. They were used to indicate divisions in a text, to tell stories, and to add beauty and visually memorable elements to texts. Manuscript illumination reached its high point in medieval Europe, when illuminators, working within workshops called scriptoria, produced illuminated psalters, Bibles, liturgical texts, illustrated saints’ lives, and other works. </p>
          <p>The page layout is not strictly defined by any decisive rule, although some frequent characteristics can be spotted. It is possible to find text divided into 2 justified columns, unjustified text on just one column, and all the variants in between. Occasionally, the text is interrupted by an image, most often the picture occupies the whole width of the page, but again, it is possible to find embedded images that are surrounded by the text. It is nonetheless possible to define some communalities, the first being the decorations to the first letters (first letter of the page, of the paragraph, just of the title). The use of colours is another most decisive communality among the various codices: while the text is almost always of neutral colours (black, brownish), the titles, subtitles, decorated letters and frames are always of bright, deep, vibrant colours. Also, illuminations are sometimes used to divide the text, to visually signal the end and the beginning of a certain block of text. Finally, most of the manuscripts taken into consideration made use of parchment as their material support. A very few illuminated fragments survive on papyrus, which is less durable than parchment. The parchment used for illuminated manuscripts is a high-quality parchment, called vellum. </p>
          <h4 data-toc-skip>The layout</h4>
          <p>Taking into consideration the abyss that separates the two media type, the webpage layout has been thought to resemble an illuminated manuscript as closely as possible. </p>
          <p>A parchment-looking background has been chosen to recreate the manuscripts material support. This background needed nonetheless to be adaptable to the features of a webpage: while old parchment often presents stains and wrecked borders, our chosen background should not exceed in those features in order to grant readability and repeatability (the image is often repeated two to three times to fit in the screen, so very noticeable stains would have hindered the seamless perception of the page). </p>
          <p>For what concerns the text, the article was divided into two columns, while the text from the front page remained on one column. This is due to the aforementioned variation in text layout and pagination observed in medieval manuscripts. The choice of separating the articles’ texts in two columns is also advantageous for avoiding over-repeating the background image, and thus creating a more eye-pleasing view. Paragraph’s first letters and titles use a distinguishable font variation, in order to visually respect the decorations on letters typical of the period. Also, the use of colours (specifically a deep red and a vivacious blue) have been used for titles and subtitles. These colours have been directly picked from some instances of real manuscripts via a very handy browser extension called Color-Picker, which allows to define the exact RBG values of a specific isolated pixel in an image. </p>
          <p>Now, for what concerns the insertion of some more “advanced” illuminations, we opted for an image, directly taken from instances of real illuminations, that has been inserted alongside the articles, but outside their actual box. Both on the front page and on the articles page, we inserted two images on the side (left side for the articles, both sided for the main page) of the text-containing boxes. The illuminations chosen contain two distinct aspects of the medieval illumination art: animals and floral plots, alongside the common feature of being extremely original and very colourful. </p>
          <h4>The colours</h4>
          <p>The colours are a fundamental part of a medieval illuminated manuscript. Trying to be as mindful of that as possible, we nonetheless isolated here the three predominant colours used to render the textual part of the webpage, also including the parchment tone we researched for the background image. For the illuminations, please refer to the pictured of manuscripts reported below.</p>

        <h3 id="1970">1970s - GrOoOovy times</h3>
          <h4 data-toc-skip>Background</h4>
          <p>1970s society, which went trhough a decade of renewed political awareness and social progressivism, continued on the path of progressive values. Hippie culture, the counterculture of the sixties, began to be more and more widepread, and was transformed in this period into a solid social and political view, which involved opposition to the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, big capitalists corporates and advocated for word peace and social equality. Movements for racial justice and gender equality also gained popularity during this period. It would not be an hyperbole to say that a cultural revolution really occurred in the 1970s. </p>
          <p>The anti-establishment trend was expressed in the use of innovative designs. This big cultural revolution, in fact, involved a shift in the common aesthetic taste, a phenomenon which also begun in the previous decade. Bright colours were everywhere, the general look was bright, sunshiny, modern, eye catchy and extravagant. The use of wide, ondulated and vertical lines and abstract weaves are common in many designs. This aesthetic pervaded almost every aspect of cultural and commercial artifacts: from shop signs to commercial banner, from albums, books and magazines covers to social and political flyers, end even entered the fashoin industry and home décor. Wall décor, in particular, made use of abstract paintings and sculptures to give a flowy and modern looking dimension to rooms. Some companies even adopted this style in their logos, expecially those who cared about young people’s attention, such as Atari, which was born during this period. </p>
          <p>Because colours are so important to this aesthetic, some popular colour combinations van be defined, remembering that, in general, bright and vibrant tones are preferred, even if some pastels tonalities can also be observed. The following is a list of the most common combinations, but many more exist. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yellow and orange </li>
            <li>Green and blue or purple </li>
            <li>Rainbow </li>
            <li>Pink and green </li>
            <li>Red blue and yellow </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 data-toc-skip>The layout</h4>
          <p>For this part of the framework, we decided to draw our inspiration from a variety of artistic fields. Since no distinctive feature emerged in the field of magazine typography during this period, we instead decided to recreate a design that could render the aesthetic previously defined. Among the artistic fields we considered during the design process, some were especially meaningful: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Music and fashion magazines (music and fashion are almost indistinguishable at this point. Musicians are fashion icons, and fashion is deeply influenced by the musical sphere)</li>
            <li>Logos and commercial items </li>
            <li>Home décor </li>
            <li>Abstract art </li>
          </ul>
          <p>For what concerns the main page of the websites, we tried to render this 70s vibe by inserting a background image recalling many of the abstract themes popular at the time. The colours chosen for the page are mostly warm and deep, but there is nonetheless place for cooler colours or pastel tones. </p>
          <p>The font family of the titles and subtitles closely recalls those big flamboyant fonts used during that time, and it is called “NewSense”. Both this font and the one used in other sections of the text are sans serif fonts, according to the predominant taste of the time as we were able to understand it. All the fonts used during the design process have been drawn from tools such as google fonts to be directly used as web fonts, or other free fonts providers, in which case the fonts have been transformed into web fonts with an online tool called “Font Squirrel”. </p>
          <p>As for the organization of the pages, for both the front page and the articles, the text is not divided in columns, as we did not find much evidence of that being a particular preference at the time. Some magazines did show text divided into columns, but we did not believe this element to be particularly significant. At the end, we decided to leave the text in one column, as if it were almost some kind of flyer, or the back cover of a record. </p>
          <p>Another important visual element we give particular importance are borders: borders recall the lines patterns we used in the background, an element that provides plasticity and a further immersion in the Seventies spirit. We used wide, double borders to frame the images and various boxes. Also, some borders are irregular and rounded, to, once again, evoke the abstract art often depicting long flows of rounded and colourful lines.  </p>
